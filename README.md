# images_with_captions_from_pexel

These images are from Pexel and thier name describes the image.

I made these to be used as Ground Truth Images when training diffusers.

**You can use these for anything unless it's not allowed in Pexel License**

If you are using this for **EverDream2** use this branch everydream2: 

https://github.com/rdcoder33/images_with_captions_from_pexel/tree/everydream2

since it already contains multiply.txt file in each folder with 0.05 value.
